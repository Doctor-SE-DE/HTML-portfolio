<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m an early-career IT professional with a strong interest in building reliable, well-structured systems — from 
  modern web applications to legacy mainframe environments. I currently work in IT, where I’ve been gaining hands-on
   experience across different technologies while continuously sharpening my technical and problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>My journey has exposed me to web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, EJS, and PostgreSQL, as well 
  as mainframe-related work including Natural programming and structured data processing. I enjoy understanding how 
  systems work end-to-end, whether it’s a user-facing interface or the logic running behind the scenes.</p>

<p>What drives me most is growth. I’m intentional about learning, open to challenges, and not afraid to start from 
  the fundamentals when stepping into new technologies. I value clean code, clarity, and solutions that are 
  practical and maintainable. Beyond the technical side, I believe good communication and consistency are just as 
  important as technical skill.</p>

<p>
  I’m currently focused on expanding my expertise, building real-world projects, and positioning myself for 
  long-term impact in the tech industry.
